// Score entry) — mutating those from a browsing screen would silently
// redirect where a score gets saved if someone switched tabs mid-browse.
// Walks a list already sorted by yearRank and, for each pair of
// consecutive rows that share the same primary tiebreak value (net-to-par
// for Solo, points for Team), explains what separated them — either which
// tiebreak level resolved it, or that they're genuinely tied and split the
// payout. Only compares immediate neighbors, so a 3+-way tie shows as a
// short chain (A beat B, B beat C) rather than one combined statement —
// simple to generate and reads naturally either way.
